                <div class="text">There are few watches that might be considered perfect and one of those is the Patek
                    Philippe Nautilus. Since the 1970’s the Nautilus has captured the watch communities attention with
                    its design and superior quality. Manufactured almost entirely by hand, each Patek Philippe Nautilus
                    can be
                    considered one of a kind but what they all share is the master craftsmanship that goes into
                    producing a
                    Patek. With the rounded octagonal shape of its bezel, the ingenious porthole construction of its
                    case, and its horizontally embossed dial, the Nautilus has epitomized the elegant sports watch since
                    1976. Forty years later, it comprises a splendid collection of models for men and women. In steel,
                    rose gold, white gold or two-tone combinations they accompany the most active lifestyles with
                    incomparable class </div>

                <div class="text"> Since Louis Cottier’s invention of this mechanism during the 1930s, the famous
                    Patek
                    Philippe World Time watches have often been adorned with maps in Grand Feu cloisonné enamel
                    depicting various regions of the world. In 2022, Patek Philippe pays tribute to the dynamism of
                    South-East Asia and to Oceania by interpreting this model in a new white gold version with a Grand
                    Feu cloisonné enamel dial. To combine geography and poetry, the artisan first marks off the outlines
                    of the continents with a thin gold wire. He then fills the compartments with various enamel colors
                    reproducing the oceans and land masses, while repeatedly firing the enameled dial plate at high
                    temperature in a kiln. Patek Philippe Complications World Time (5231J001) self -
                    winding automatic watch, features a 38.5mm 18k yellow gold case.
